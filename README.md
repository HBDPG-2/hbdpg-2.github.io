## About

**HBDPG-2** *(Hashing-based Deterministic Password Generator â€“ 2nd Gen)* is a open-source, cross-platform Web-application for deterministic password generation with a focus on security and brute-force attack resistance.

To generate a password, you must use **two different passphrases** that are at least 8 characters long. **Use strong passphrases** to make brute-force attacks more difficult! You can also use "Advanced features" to enhance security.

The generated password is 32 characters long by default and contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. This meets all modern password standards.

The generation result is deterministic. Next time you need this password, enter your passphrases to get it.

## Advanced features

> Will be added later...

## Built-in security features

* **High device performance requirements** slow down the algorithm and make brute-force attacks more difficult.

* **2-Factor Deterministic Generation (2-FDG)** significantly increases the possible number of combinations and make brute-force attacks more difficult.

* **Reversibility Protection** prevents the generated hash from being revealed if your password is compromised.

* **Result Checking** ensures that the generated password meets all security requirements and standards.
